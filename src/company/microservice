5. Microservices Tooling Supports
5.1 Using Spring for creating Microservices

    - Setup new service by using Spring Boot
    - Expose resources via a RestController
    - Consume remote services using RestTemplate
    
    

6. Developing Simple Microservices Example
For build a simple microservices system following steps required

    Creating Discovery Service (Creating Eureka Discovery Service)
    Creating MicroService (the Producer)
        Register itself with Discovery Service with logical service.
    Create Microservice Consumers find Service registered with Discovery Service
        Discovery client using a smart RestTemplate to find microservice.
    
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Step 1: Creating Discovery Service (Creating Eureka Discovery Service)
•	Eureka Server using Spring Cloud
•	We need to implement our own registry service as below.
Run this Eureka Server application with right click and run as Spring Boot Application and open in browser http://localhost:1111/


Step 2: Creating Account Producer MicroService
Microservice declares itself as an available service and register to Discovery Server created in Step 1.
•	Using @EnableDiscoveryClient
•	Registers using its application name

Now run this account service application as Spring Boot application and after few seconds refresh browser to the home page of Eureka Discovery Server at http://localhost:1111/ in previous Step 1. Now one Service registered to the Eureka registered instances with Service Name “ACCOUNT-MICROSERVICE” as below

Step 3: Consumer Service
•	Create Consumers to find the Producer Service registered with Discovery Service at Step 1.
•	@EnableDiscoveryClient annotation also allows us to query Discovery server to find miroservices.


Now run this consumer service application as Spring Boot application and after few seconds refresh browser to the home page of Eureka Discovery Server at http://localhost:1111/ in previous Step 1. Now one more Service registered to the Eureka registered instances with Service Name “ACCOUNTS-WEB” as below

Lets our consumer consume the service of producer registered at discovery server.
See this class : RemoteAccountRepository 

Lets open web application which is a consumer of the account microservice registered at Eureka Discovery Server.
http://localhost:8080/ as below
Now click on View Account List then fetch all accounts from account microservice.
http://localhost:8080/accountList
Now click on any account from the list of accounts to fetch the details of account for account number from account microservice.
http://localhost:8080/accountDetails?number=5115
